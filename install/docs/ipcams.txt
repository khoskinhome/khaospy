It works with Synology Surveillance Station.

Configure like this: Port: 8899 Brand: [ONVIF] Model: Generic_ONVIF In VLC you can open the HD (704x576) stream by: rtsp://IPHERE//user=admin_password=_channel=1_stream=0.sdp And the lower quality (352x288) stream by: rtsp://192.168.4.20//user=admin_password=_channel=1_stream=0.sdp The webinterface, ONVIF port and URL's are the same as on the ESCAM QD500, i think they use the same chipset. Snapshot of HQ stream: http://i.imgur.com/aKz2mU0.jpg Running a portscan shows that port 80 is open (webinterface, configure the cam via Internet Explorer because crappy ActiveX component is needed). But port 23 (Telnet) is also open. Login with root and password 'xmhdipc'. Again, same as on ESCAM QD500, that's why i know all this ;) Device is 4x4x3,7cm
(length of lens included) Gets quite warm after a while, i measured 36-38 degrees Celsius with IR-tempgun. Lens is threaded, can be adjusted by rotating in/out if wanted. Sturdy metal casing NO adapter included! Just use a 12V 1A (center positive) from an old router or so All in all good image for the price, and nice that it works with Synology. Unfortunately no snapshot.cgi URL or so, therefore -1 star
