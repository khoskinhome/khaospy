High Prio
---------

raise proper exceptions and don't just die.

conf.

    get daemon-runner using the pi-host.json
    new khaospy-run-daemons-from-pi-hosts.pl
        generate the cli-opts from the config.



    add option in config to graph-controls

    need an rrd-config. for grouping. maybe.


        deprecate Khaospy::PiHostPublishers. move its stuff into Khaospy::Conf::PiHosts


    move the PiGPIO stuff out from PiControllerDaemon and into PiGPIO.

    Go over the Controller and ControllerQueue and tidy up. proper exception handling. Try::Tiny.

starting writing the PiMCP23017 module . need this  for th alarm switch panel.  with tests. lots of work.

    daemons need locking. the "/usr/bin/daemon" should do this , but it looked broken recently.


Medium Prio
-----------

redo the raspian image on the piold in the playhouse.
    have to get the frickin wifi thing working .



Low prio
--------

    onewire sender in perl. low priority. python one is working.

    rrd-creater in perl. low prio. python one is working.
        temp rrds
        switch / relay / control rrds.


    conf-dist-daemon in perl. very low prio. I can do this with tar-over-ssh, scp etc.

    daemon-monitor. long way off. i.e. when I've got the reset of the stuff working.
