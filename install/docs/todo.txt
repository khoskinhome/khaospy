High Prio
---------
raise proper named exceptions and don't just die.

Test that PiControllerDaemon.pm subscribes to the correct hosts.

Test that the following stuff works
    pi-gpio-relay
    pi-gpio-relay-manual
        make an ex-or type circuit and test that.

Get the electronic/physical PiMCP23017 interface working

write the code in Khaospy::PiControlMCP23017

run it on PiServer for the Alarm Interface board.

wire up some alarm-sensors.

write the :
    stuff to get boiler control actaully running on a pi-gpio-relay-manual.

    a quick CH Webpage.


Conf::PiHosts.

    Go over the PiControllerDaemon and PiControllerQueueDaemon and tidy up. proper exception handling. Try::Tiny. and raise proper exeptions. not dies. give them a name.

Starting writing the PiMCP23017 module . need this  for th alarm switch panel.  with tests. lots of work. ( finish of the PiGPIO first, some of the logic could be shared. )

    daemons need locking. the "/usr/bin/daemon" should do this , but it looked broken recently.

    fix the quoting of CLI params in khaospy-run-daemons.pl

    Khaospy::RRDGraphDaemon
        need an rrd-config. for grouping. maybe.
        use the control config "rrd_graph" for what to graph.
        has to listen to all different message status streams.

    a better way of distributing the /etc/hosts. preferably just go for a DNS server for my local hostnames.

    make boiler on/off with rad states page.

Why are there a lot of tmpfs using up lots of ram on jessie version of raspibian ?

Medium Prio
-----------

Implement for the OrviboS20 : remember the last state, and if its been manually operated by something other than khaospy. just like the PiGPIO relay-manual controls. Useful for "rules". Useful if I use them for light-switches.

pi dns and dhcp server.

pibastion that I can open to the net and just get stats.

Low prio
--------

    onewire sender in perl. low priority. python one is working.

    rrd-creater in perl. low prio. python one is working.
        temp rrds
        switch / relay / control rrds.


    conf-dist-daemon in perl. very low prio. I can do this with tar-over-ssh, scp etc.

    daemon-monitor. long way off. i.e. when I've got the rest of the stuff working, with some sort of webui (or openhab)
