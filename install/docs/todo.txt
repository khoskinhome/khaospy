High Prio
---------

CommandQueueDaemon

    get the QueueCommand.pm to 
        subscribe to 

zmq-PUBlish ( not REQuest ) to port



fix the KhaospyControlPiMCP23017.t tests.


./bin dir and a ./daemons dir. split up what's in bin-dir

make sure logs go to usb stick on the pis.

daemon locking . only one command-queue, pi-controls, other-controls per host.


Other-Controls-Daemon ( initially for OrviboS20s )

    write manual_auto_timeout ( like relay-manual code )

    remove the rand() in the time checking of the last-poll part.


Pi-Control-Daemon
    use the ControlDispatch.pm. tricky.
    if the gpio or i2c commands fail during initialisation the daemon should die. The ports will not be in the correct state.



The messages to support new fields
    "action_by"  This will currently be :
        Manual ( a plain old wall switch operated it. or something outside khaospy)
        Manual-WebUI ( someone click in the webui )
        Auto-Rules
    So an action knows the classification of what called it.
    last_change_state_by

    Rules will then be able to be subtle.
    i.e. if a light is operated by a manual wall switch then the rules-d can be more subtle.
    The manual_auto_timeout could be deprecated if the rules-D can be made aware of the action_by information.

    ( action_by_user to indicate user-name. do we need this ? )



a way of distributing the confs to all hosts.
    scp / tar . whatever. something quick and easy.


pi-hosts. config checking. make sure there is only :
    one heating-control-daemon
    one boiler-daemon
    one rules-daemon


get BoilerDaemon.pm able to use the ControlPi stuff.
    BoilerDaemon needs to listen to the outputs of :
        PiControlD
        OtherControlD
    for the state of controls.

    The refresh status can be dropped.
        ( once I've got other Controls polling )



make a lead to run thermometers and both i2cs for piserver.


write a cli tool that will summarise the confs nicely .
    pi-hosts
    controls
    one-wire-heating-daemon
    boiler

get HeatingDaemon
    able to use the ControlPi stuff..
    make the pi-hosts config die if there is more than one-heating-control-daemon configured.

status-d
    listens to all things.
    has http rest api
    use AnyEvent.


get piboiler able to run the PC-queue-d.
    try reinstall of dependencies.

In my loft.
    thermometers in my room , kitchen and my loft.
    i2c-controller.

    get the outside thermometer working properly.

    maybe get ali's window switch wired in to alarm board.




jumper pins from PHouse. leave some in the alarm-panel.

write more tests for the the code in Khaospy::PiControlMCP23017

raise proper named exceptions and don't just die.

Test that PiControllerDaemon.pm subscribes to the correct hosts.

Test that the following stuff works
    pi-gpio-relay
    pi-gpio-relay-manual
        make an ex-or type circuit and test that.

Get the electronic/physical PiMCP23017 interface working


run it on PiServer for the Alarm Interface board.

wire up some alarm-sensors.

write the :
    stuff to get boiler control actaully running on a pi-gpio-relay-manual.

    a quick CH Webpage.


Conf::PiHosts.

    Go over the PiControllerDaemon and CommandQueueDaemon and tidy up. proper exception handling. Try::Tiny. and raise proper exeptions. not dies. give them a name.

Starting writing the PiMCP23017 module . need this  for th alarm switch panel.  with tests. lots of work. ( finish of the PiGPIO first, some of the logic could be shared. )

    daemons need locking. the "/usr/bin/daemon" should do this , but it looked broken recently.

    fix the quoting of CLI params in khaospy-run-daemons.pl

    Khaospy::RRDGraphDaemon
        need an rrd-config. for grouping. maybe.
        use the control config "rrd_graph" for what to graph.
        has to listen to all different message status streams.

    a better way of distributing the /etc/hosts. preferably just go for a DNS server for my local hostnames.

    make boiler on/off with rad states page.

Why are there a lot of tmpfs using up lots of ram on jessie version of raspibian ?

Medium Prio
-----------

Multiway lighting, am I going to program up something in khaospy for Amelia's controller ? Am I going to build a new controller using SSRs ?



does the pi-host.conf need to have valid_i2c_buses ? This can be worked out with an i2c-detect ? maybe I need both. When khaospy actually runs on the host then it can do  an i2c-detect too.


control config. an option for db-logging of state changes. ( already have the rrd_graph option )


Implement for the OrviboS20 : remember the last state, and if its been manually operated by something other than khaospy. just like the PiGPIO relay-manual controls. Useful for "rules". Useful if I use them for light-switches.


pi dns and dhcp server.


pibastion that I can open to the net and just get stats.

Low prio
--------

    onewire sender in perl. low priority. python one is working.

    rrd-creater in perl. low prio. python one is working.
        temp rrds
        switch / relay / control rrds.


    conf-dist-daemon in perl. very low prio. I can do this with tar-over-ssh, scp etc.

    daemon-monitor. long way off. i.e. when I've got the rest of the stuff working, with some sort of webui (or openhab)
