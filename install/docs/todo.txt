High Prio
---------

error handling of mcp23017 read and write errors.

get OneWireHeatingDaemon
    able to use the ControlPi stuff..
    listen to the PiControllers for updates.
        (then I can use the window switches,before I get the full-blown-rules-daemon working )


get BoilerDaemon.pm able to use the ControlPi stuff.

get piboiler able to run the PC-queue-d.
    try reinstall of dependencies.

In my loft.
    thermometers in my room , kitchen and my loft.
    i2c-controller.
        Can I use the secondary i2c-bus on PiB+ ?
        Make a test lead.

    get the outside one working properly.

    maybe get ali's window switch wired in to alarm board.








jumper pins from PHouse. leave some in the alarm-panel.

write more tests for the the code in Khaospy::PiControlMCP23017

raise proper named exceptions and don't just die.

Test that PiControllerDaemon.pm subscribes to the correct hosts.

Test that the following stuff works
    pi-gpio-relay
    pi-gpio-relay-manual
        make an ex-or type circuit and test that.

Get the electronic/physical PiMCP23017 interface working


run it on PiServer for the Alarm Interface board.

wire up some alarm-sensors.

write the :
    stuff to get boiler control actaully running on a pi-gpio-relay-manual.

    a quick CH Webpage.


Conf::PiHosts.

    Go over the PiControllerDaemon and PiControllerQueueDaemon and tidy up. proper exception handling. Try::Tiny. and raise proper exeptions. not dies. give them a name.

Starting writing the PiMCP23017 module . need this  for th alarm switch panel.  with tests. lots of work. ( finish of the PiGPIO first, some of the logic could be shared. )

    daemons need locking. the "/usr/bin/daemon" should do this , but it looked broken recently.

    fix the quoting of CLI params in khaospy-run-daemons.pl

    Khaospy::RRDGraphDaemon
        need an rrd-config. for grouping. maybe.
        use the control config "rrd_graph" for what to graph.
        has to listen to all different message status streams.

    a better way of distributing the /etc/hosts. preferably just go for a DNS server for my local hostnames.

    make boiler on/off with rad states page.

Why are there a lot of tmpfs using up lots of ram on jessie version of raspibian ?

Medium Prio
-----------

does the pi-host.conf need to have valid_i2c_buses ? This can be worked out with an i2c-detect ? maybe I need both. When khaospy actually runs on the host then it can do  an i2c-detect too.


control config. an option for db-logging of state changes. ( already have the rrd_graph option )


Implement for the OrviboS20 : remember the last state, and if its been manually operated by something other than khaospy. just like the PiGPIO relay-manual controls. Useful for "rules". Useful if I use them for light-switches.


pi dns and dhcp server.


pibastion that I can open to the net and just get stats.

Low prio
--------

    onewire sender in perl. low priority. python one is working.

    rrd-creater in perl. low prio. python one is working.
        temp rrds
        switch / relay / control rrds.


    conf-dist-daemon in perl. very low prio. I can do this with tar-over-ssh, scp etc.

    daemon-monitor. long way off. i.e. when I've got the rest of the stuff working, with some sort of webui (or openhab)
