High Prio
---------

raise proper named exceptions and don't just die.


Test that PiControllerDaemon.pm subscribes to the correct hosts.




Conf::PiHosts.


    Go over the Controller and ControllerQueue and tidy up. proper exception handling. Try::Tiny. and raise proper exeptions. not dies. give them a name.


starting writing the PiMCP23017 module . need this  for th alarm switch panel.  with tests. lots of work.

    daemons need locking. the "/usr/bin/daemon" should do this , but it looked broken recently.

    fix the quoting of CLI params in khaospy-run-daemons.pl


    Khaospy::RRDGraphDaemon
        need an rrd-config. for grouping. maybe.
        use the control config "rrd_graph" for what to graph.
        has to listen to all different message status streams.

    a better way of distributing the /etc/hosts. preferably just go for a DNS server for my local hostnames.

    make boiler on/off with rad states page.

why are there a lot of tmpfs using up lots of ram on jessie version of raspibian ?

Medium Prio
-----------

pi dns and dhcp server.

pibastion that I can open to the net and just get stats.

redo the raspian image on the piold in the playhouse.
    have to get the frickin wifi thing working .



Low prio
--------

    onewire sender in perl. low priority. python one is working.

    rrd-creater in perl. low prio. python one is working.
        temp rrds
        switch / relay / control rrds.


    conf-dist-daemon in perl. very low prio. I can do this with tar-over-ssh, scp etc.

    daemon-monitor. long way off. i.e. when I've got the reset of the stuff working.
