dd image on to micro-sd card.

raspi-config :
    expand the file system
    change user "pi" password
    boot option to console with password
    advanced options
        change hostname
        i2c enable
        ssh-login-enable.

    get the mac-address and add a dhcp config in the tp-link so it will always get the same ip-address.

    copy over the ssh public key, and put in .ssh/authorized_keys

    change visudo to use vim

    /boot/config.txt can need editting to get one-wire working .

    looks like i2c might need dtparam too.
    one wire needs this in the /boot/config.txt :
        dtoverlay=w1-gpio


i2c stuff :

    getting i2c-0 working on Pi2 :
        add the kernel parm "bcm2708.vc_i2c_override=1" to /boot/cmdline.txt
        and "dtparam=i2c_vc=on" to /boot/config.txt



still to do :

    add a USB flash mem stick. (small one form factor ) 16 GB.
    get the USB mounting in /etc/fstab.


once fully setup "dd" the micro-sd card and get an image
