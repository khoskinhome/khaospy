"""
khaospy.mcp23017BoilerRadiator
is going to be very similar to
khaospy.mcp23017MultiLightSingleWayManual

so this is only going to get written once I have khaospy.mcp23017MultiLightSingleWayManual working.
they both may be able to share a base class.

They are both solving a similar problem.

Although for boiler/radiator there is just one circuit.


For a boiler this class will get instantiated twice, once for "hot water" the other for "heating".
